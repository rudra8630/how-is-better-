  <p class="p2"> Iron Man had so many suits he bistro them in ironman 3 and the Avengers Infinity and Avengers Endgame suits are
    marked 50 and 85 and all of the suits can shoot repulsors from hands, chest and shoot meine missiles forearm and
    hand. It is like future suits. In this category, Ironman wins.

  <p class="p2"> Ironman stores the fighting skill of his enemy and heroes so he can learn their style of fighting and weakness.
    His fighting skill is Wing Chun.

  <p class="p2">Iron Man's Origin Story. Young Tony Stark was a prodigy of mechanical engineering genius. At 21, he took over
    his father's company and launched it into a hugely successful corporation. During testing of new technology in
    Vietnam, Tony was hit by a piece of shrapnel from a booby trap.
    Ironman is better in suits and weapons than Batman. In fighting, they are tied and their backstory is your opinion.
